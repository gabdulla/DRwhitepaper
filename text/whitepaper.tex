\begin{abstract}
Some of the largest supercomputer centers in the United 
States are developing new relationships with their 
electricity providers.  These relationships, similar to other commercial 
and industrial facilities, are driven by mutual interest— to save energy 
costs and improve electricity grid reliability.  Supercomputer centers are concerned about 
electricity price, quality, environmental impact and 
availability. Electricity providers are concerned about 
supercomputer center's impact on the electrical grid reliability, both 
for energy consumption, peak power and fluctuations in 
power. Supercomputer center power demand can be greater 
than 20 megawatts (MW), theoretical peak power requirements 
greater than 45MW and re-occurring intra-hour variability 
can exceed 8MW. As a consequence, there are some 
supercomputer centers whose electricity providers are 
asking for hourly forecasts of power demand, a day in 
advance.   This paper explores today's relationships, 
potential partnerships and possible integration between 
supercomputer centers and their electricity providers and its value. It 
develops a model for possible integration between 
supercomputer centers and the electrical grid. It then 
explores the utility of this model based on feedback from a 
questionnaire of Top 100 List sized supercomputer centers 
in the United States.
